# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on adding a skybox to the Bevy game.

## Recent Changes

- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` to establish initial project documentation.
- Created `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` to further document project context.
- Created `progress.md` to track project progress.
- Created `src/systems/skybox.rs` and implemented basic skybox system.
- Integrated `setup_skybox` system into `src/plugins/game.rs`.
- Asked user to provide placeholder skybox images.
- Updated `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `productContext.md` to reflect current task status and documentation.

## Next Steps

- Run the game again to verify the skybox implementation after correcting import issues in `src/plugins/game.rs`.
- If compilation is successful and skybox is visible, ask user to confirm.
- If compilation fails, further debug import issues.

## Active Decisions

- Using placeholder solid color images for the skybox initially (bright pink for debugging).

## Considerations

- Performance impact of the skybox. (Minimal for placeholder images)
- Compatibility with existing game elements. (Should be compatible)
- Aesthetic style of the skybox. (Placeholder will be basic, can be improved later)
